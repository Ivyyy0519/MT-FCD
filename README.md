# MT-FCD
Traditional causal discovery aims at inferring causal relations from centralized observational data. However, due to the data privacy issue, more data owners refuse to share their personalized data, making this task challenging in practice. In this report, under the assumption of linear additive model and invariant DAG, we developed a multi-task federated causal discovery method MT-FCD by adding the group sparse regularization and mean regularization terms. Each device consists of an individual continuous optimization task that takes advantage of an equality acyclicity constraint. The server aims at solving the unsmooth group sparsity term while communicating with each device without accessing the raw data. Experiments on synthetic datasets verify the efficacy of the method.
